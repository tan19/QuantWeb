        === "Python"
            ``` Python
            class Solution:
            def findTheWinner(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
                def helper(m):
                    if m == 1: return 0 # index starts from 0
                    return (helper(m - 1) + k) % m

                return helper(n) + 1 # convert back to start from 1
            ```

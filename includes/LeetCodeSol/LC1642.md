??? Note "LC1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach (Medium)"    
    === "Info"
        - **<a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach/" target="_blank">LC1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach (Medium)</a>**
        - Algorithm: Binary Search
        - Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$
        - Space Complexity: $O(1)$

    === "Solution"
        Binary search to propose the furthest building you try to reach, which costs $O(\log n)$. Within each proposal, it takes $O(n)$ to check if you are indeed able to finish. Total cost is thus $O(n \log n)$.

        === "Python"
            ``` Python
            class Solution:
                def canFinish(self, heights, bricks, ladders) -> bool:    
                    steps = sorted([heights[i] - heights[i-1] for i in range(1, len(heights)) if heights[i] - heights[i-1] > 0])
                            
                    if not steps:
                        return True

                    if ladders == 0:
                        return bricks >= sum(steps)

                    return bricks >= sum(steps[:-ladders])

                def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
                    left, right = 0, len(heights) - 1
                    while left <= right:
                        mid = (left + right) // 2
                        if self.canFinish(heights[:mid+1], bricks, ladders):
                            left = mid + 1
                        else:
                            right = mid - 1
                    
                    return max(0, right)

??? Note "FAQ0001. Compare Procedural vs OOP"
    === "Question"
        Compare procedual and OOP.

    === "Answer"
        Procedual programming has two distinct features: 1) `data` and `operations` are seperated; 2) only two types of data `local` and `global`.

        The drawback of the first is that it is not a good approximation of the real world. For the second, global data design makes it **everything is related to everything else**, which is overly complex and hard to maintain and extend.

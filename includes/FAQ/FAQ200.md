    === "Info"

        - Algorithm: Binary Search
        - Time Complexity: $O(\log n)$
        - Space Complexity: $O(1)$

    === "Strong Reference"
        Strong reference informs garbage collector that the object is not ready to be garbage collected.
    === "Weak Reference"
        A *weak reference*, simply put, is a reference that isn't strong enough to force an object to remain in memory. A weak reference allows a variable to hold the reference to an object without incrementing the reference counter.
        === "Python"
            ``` Python            
            class Solution:
                def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
                    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

                    while left <= right:
                        mid = (left + right) // 2

                        if nums[mid] == target:
                            return mid
                        elif target < nums[mid]:
                            right = mid - 1
                        else:
                            left = mid + 1

                    return left
            ```

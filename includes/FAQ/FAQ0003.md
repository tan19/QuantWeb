        What is a reference? How is it different from a pointer?

    === "Answer"
        A pointer is a separate variable; a reference is an alias to its target. Reference cannot be reassigned.

        A reference may or may not be implemented as a pointer. Usually in a local scope, no storage is allocated; while in class/struct, storage is allocated.

        For example, the following will print 4 and 8. 

        ``` C++            
        #include <iostream>
        #include<algorithm>

        using namespace std;

        int main(){
            struct s { int & x; };
            const int &x = 1;

            std::cout << sizeof(x) << std::endl;
            std::cout << sizeof(s) << std::endl;
        }
        ```

        Also, a reference can point to null as well, although the behavior is undefined. For example, `int &x = *(int*)0;` in some compilers, this compiles. Also, References cannot be put into an array. It's neither possible to get the address of a reference - the address operator will return the address of the referenced value instead - nor is it possible to do arithmetics on references.

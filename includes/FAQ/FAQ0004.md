        Why is it preferable to pass-by-reference rather than pass-by-value?

    === "Answer"
        Pass by value is expensive and sometimes impossible (when copy constructor is unavailable); so people usually pass a constant reference to a function.
        
        Moreover, we can use reference to prevent unwanted casting. Consider the following code:

        ``` C++            
        #include <iostream>
        #include<algorithm>

        using namespace std;

        class Base {
        public:
            virtual string msg(){ return "I am base"; }
        };

        class Child : public Base {
        public:
            virtual string msg(){ return "I am child"; }
        };

        void cast(Base x){ cout << x.msg() << endl; }

        int main(){
            Base f;
            Child b;

            cast(f);
            cast(b);
        }
        ``` 
        The output is two "I am base". If we change `cast(Base x)` to `cast(Base& x)`, the output will be "I am base" and "I am child".

### LC1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days (Medium)
???+ Note "LC1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days (Medium)"    
    === "Info"
        - **<a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/" target="_blank">LC1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days (Medium)</a>**
        - Algorithm: Binary Search
        - Time Complexity: $O(n\log(S))$, where $S$ is the sum of all weights.
        - Space Complexity: $O(1)$

    === "Solution"
        Binary search for the $\mbox{capacity} \in [max(weights), sum(weights)]$. For each of these $O(\log n)$ capacity, it costs $O(n)$ to check if the plan can be delivered. Total cost is thus $O(n \log n)$.

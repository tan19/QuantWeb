# Vector Calculus

!!! note "Definition: Vector Field"    
    A **vector field** is a vector function $\FF : \RRR^n \to \RRR^n$.   
Vector fields can usefully be thought of as representing the velocity of a moving flow in space, and this physical intuition leads to notions such as the *divergence* (which represents the rate of change of volume of a flow) and *curl* (which represents the rotation of a flow). Line integral is the tool to use in the context of vector fields.

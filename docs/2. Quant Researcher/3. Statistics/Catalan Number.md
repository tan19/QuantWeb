# Catalan Number

In chapter \ref{chapter: Bertrand_Ballot_prob}, we first met Catalan number from the generalized Bertrand's Ballot prob. We write here again the definition of Catalan number, with an intuitive interpretation.

The Catalan number\index{Catalan number} is defined as,
\begin{equation}
	C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n}
\end{equation}
The underlying story reads: Given two urns, one with $n$ red balls and the other with $n$ black balls, we want to draw one ball at a time (either red or black), such that at no time the number of pre-specified color is less than its alternative.

Since the Catalan number is associated with two equal-sized sets, it is oftentimes co-occurrent  with the words "pair", "full binary", and etc.

# 1. Preprocessing
Preprocessing provides `macro substituting`, `conditional compilation`, and `source file inclusion`. In addition, directives are provided to control line numbering in diagnostics and for symbolic debugging, to generate a diagnostic message with a  given token sequence, and to perform implementation-dependent actions (the `#proagma` directive).

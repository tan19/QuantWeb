# Chapter 6. Interfaces, Lambda Expressions, and Inner Classes

## Anonymous Inner Class
If you want to make only a single object of this class, you don't even need to give the class a name. Such a class is called an *anonymous inner class*. Anonymous classes cannot have a constructor (in C++ and Java) but can have a destructor (this is for C++; there's no destructor in Java, instead we have Garbage Collector in Java).


!!! note "Anonymous Inner Class"
    === "Java"
        ``` Java
            var obj = new SuperType(construction parameters) {
                 // even though an anonymous class cannot have constructors, 
                 // you can provide an object initialization block
                { initialization }
                ...
            }
        ```
        The `SuperType` can be an interface, then the inner class implements that interface. It can also be a class, then the inner class extends that class.
    === "C++"
        There is no equivalent such a concept in C++, although the concept of `anonymous class` exists. To declare an anonymous class and its variables, just ignore the class name, as in:
        ``` C++
            class {
            public:
                void f() {
                    std::cout << "I am an object of an anonymous class." << std::endl;
                }
            } obj1, obj2;
        ```

        The closest equivalent to Java anonymous inner classes in C++ is to use a private class which implements the corresponding interface (but if the interface is a functional interface, then the closest equivalent is to replace the functional interface with a function pointer and the anonymous inner class with a lambda).

    === "Python"
        In Python, you can use the `type(name, bases, dict)` builtin function to crate on the fly. For example:
        ``` Python
            class ParentClass:
                pass

            op = type("ChildClass", (ParentClass, object), {"foo" : lambda self: print("foo")})
            op().foo()
        ```

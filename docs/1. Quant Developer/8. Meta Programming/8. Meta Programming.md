# Python Meta Programming

There are five main meta programming techniques in Python:

At load-time:
- Operator overloading
- Decorator
- Metaclass
- Descriptor and Property
- Import hook

At run-time:
- compile
- Monkey Patch and Hot Patch


## Import Hooks
Whenever you use an `import` statement, it is equivalent to:
``` Python
os = __import__("os")
```

- First, it check `sys.modules`, a dict containing already-loaded modules, just in case we've already imported the requested module.
- Next, if `sys.meta_path` list is not empty, then every meta importer hook in it will be queried.
- Finally, it checks `sys.path`, a list containing filesystem paths for Python to search for potential modules.

It is at the second step that we will be able to intercept. To do this, we'll need to crate a `meta path finder`, which has a single public method `find_spec`, and add it to `sys.meta_path`.

``` Python
import importlib.abc
import importlib.machinery

class DependencyInjectorFinder(importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder):
    def __init__(self, loader):
        # we'll write the loader in a minute, hang tight
        self._loader = loader
    def find_spec(self, fullname, path, target=None):
        """Attempt to locate the requested module
        fullname is the fully-qualified name of the module,
        path is set to __path__ for sub-modules/packages, or None otherwise.
        target can be a module object, but is unused in this example.
        """
        if self._loader.provides(fullname):
            return self._gen_spec(fullname)
    def _gen_spec(self, fullname):
        spec = importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec(fullname, self._loader)
        return spec
# we'll also add it to sys.meta_path later
```

If a meta path finder provides the requested module, then it should return an instance of the importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec class, which is a fairly simple affair with a small handful of attributes that lets Python's import machinery know what it needs to know to take the next steps in importing the module the user requested. For our purposes, we're interested in two attributes (the only required ones): ModuleSpec.name, which is the name of the requested module, and ModuleSpec.loader, which is the loader object that Python should use to actually load the module - you'll notice the self._loader lines above that reference a loader object, as well. 

A loader object is a very simple class with two required methods in Python:

- `create_module`, which takes a `ModuleSpec` as its sole argument and returns an object that Python will consider to be the new module, and 
- `exec_module`, which takes the new module as its sole argument and executes it.
``` python
class Loader(importlib.abc.Loader):
    def create_module(self, spec):
        raise NotImplementedError
    def exec_module(self, module):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

# SOLID

First introduced by Robert C. Martin in 2000, SOLID stands for:

- Single-responsibility principle: Every class should have only one responsibility.
- Open-closed principle: "Software entitles should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
- Interface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
- Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

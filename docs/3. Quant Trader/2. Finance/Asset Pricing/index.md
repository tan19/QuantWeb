# Asset Pricing

Suppose that, the $N$ securities, together with $S$ possible market states, are given by an $N \times S$ matrix $D$, with $D_{ij}$ denoting the payoff by security $i$ in state $j$; and the security prices are given by some $q \in \RRR^N$. Then, a portfolio $\theta \in \RRR^N$ has market value $q^T\theta$ and payoff $D^T\theta \in \RRR^S$.

An arbitrage is a portfolio $\theta \in \RRR^N$ with $q^T\theta \le 0$ and $D^T\theta > 0$, or $q^T\theta < 0$ and $D^T\theta \ge 0$. In effect, an arbitrage is a ``free lunch''.

A state-price vector, also called the ``Arrow-Debreu'' security price, is a vector of prices of contracts that pay one unit of numeraire if a particular state occurs in the future and pay zero otherwise.

There is no arbitrage if and only if there is a state-price vector, that is, $q = D\psi$.	$q^T \theta = (D\psi)^T \theta$. QED.

The factors that affect these state prices are:
-  The preferences for consumption and t he productivity of capital.
- The probabilities of states.
- The preferences, i.e., the utility function, of the agent.

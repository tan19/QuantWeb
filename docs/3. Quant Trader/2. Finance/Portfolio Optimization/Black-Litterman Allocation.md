# Black-Litterman Allocation

## Introduction
The Black-Litterman is a model for portfolio allocation developed in 1990 at Goldman Sachs by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman. The model tries to solve the problems with the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT, the mean-variance approach of Markowitz), essentially with the generalization ability of the model. This is the motivation behind the Bayesian treatment of the Black-Litterman model.

## The Prior
The model uses market equilibrium returns as the prior, which are obtained by holding a CAPM market portfolio - one which theoretically contains all assets in the universe.

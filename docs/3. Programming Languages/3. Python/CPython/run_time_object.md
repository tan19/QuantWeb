# Run-time Object
## Code Object
Consider the following program:
```Python
def f(x):
    return x + 1

f(1)
```
Whatever the function `f()` does, it is not a part of the module's bytecode.
```Python
  1           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object f at 0x7fc4516e2c30, file "example.py", line 1>)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('f')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (f)

  4           8 LOAD_NAME                0 (f)
             10 LOAD_CONST               2 (1)
             12 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             14 POP_TOP
             16 LOAD_CONST               3 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object f at 0x7fc4516e2c30, file "example.py", line 1>:
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
```

## Function Object
A `function object`, however, is not merely a `code object`. It must include additional information such as the function name, docstring, default arguments and values of variables defined in the enclosing scope. This information, together with a code object, is stored inside a function object. The `MAKE_FUNCTION` instruction is used to create it. It may be the case that several function objects reference a single code object. Here is an example:
```Python
def make_add_x(x):
    def add_x(y):
        return x + y
    return add_x

add_4 = make_add_x(4)
add_5 = make_add_x(5)
```
The bytecode of the `make_add_x()` function contains the `MAKE_FUNCTION` instruction. The functions `add_4()` and `add_5()` are the result of calling this instruction with the same code object as an argument. But there is one argument that differs â€“ the value of `x`. Each function gets its own by the mechanism of cell variables that allows us to create `closures` like `add_4()` and `add_5()`.


## Frame Object
When the VM executes a code object, it has to keep track of the values of variables and the constantly changing value stack. It also needs to remember where it stopped executing the current code object to execute another and where to go on return. CPython stores this information inside a frame object, or simply a frame. **A frame provides a state in which a code object can be executed.** 

The first frame is created to execute the module's code object. CPython creates a new frame whenever it needs to execute another code object. Each frame has a reference to the previous frame. Thus, frames form a stack of frames, also known as the call stack, with the current frame sitting on top. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack. On return from the currently executing frame, CPython continues the execution of the previous frame by remembering its last processed instruction. In some sense, the CPython VM does nothing but constructs and executes the frames.

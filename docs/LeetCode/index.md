Algorithm design is mainly about **how to reduce problem size and to avoid repetitive computation**. 

Input ranges and sizes usually give you a hint. For example, for strings, you might want to consider using a fixed list of length 26 to represent your inputs. Another example would be, if you see the range of the possible answers is small, you may want to consider using binary search.
